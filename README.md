Yes, I know the certificate is probably expired.  Nobody uses the site anyways. :(

Crowd-sourced food truck tracker written in Go.  I built this, I think, in 2017.  Finally got off my butt and released the code.

Requires:

* Julien Schmidt's httprouter
* [pq] - A pure Go postgres driver for Go's database/sql package
* PostGIS Postgres extension
